The main distinguishing characteristic of Theta is its architecture that allows the definition of input formalisms with higher level language front-ends, and the combination of various abstract domains, interpreters, and strategies for abstraction and refinement. Theta can both serve as a model checking backend, and also includes ready-to-use, stand-alone tools.</p>"},{"location":"Algorithms/","title":"Algorithms","text":""},{"location":"Formalisms/","title":"Formalisms","text":"<p>Abstract</p> <p>A formalism is a language with precise syntax and semantics.
