This project contains the Symbolic Transition System (STS) formalism. It is a generic, low-level formalism that can describe any kind of system using variables and initial/transition expressions. The project also includes

* a domain specific language (DSL) to parse STSs from a textual representation,
* a frontend that can parse systems described in the [AIGER](http://fmv.jku.at/aiger/) (And-Inverter Graph) format and represent them using STSs,
* STS specific analysis modules enabling the algorithms to operate on them.
