/**
 * This class handles the creation, registering and execution of monitor checkpoints. If you would
 * like to add a new checkpoint do the following: 1, Add its name below to checkpointNames in the
 * companion object (from then on it will be automatically created) 2, Wherever you would like to
 * execute it, add a MonitorCheckpoint.execute(<name>) call 3, Register your monitors to it so they
 * are executed when the checkpoint is executed: (MonitorCheckpoint.register)
