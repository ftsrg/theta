/**
 * This package contains types (e.g., Boolean, integer) and expressions operating over them (e.g.,
 * Boolean connectives, arithmetic operations), grouped into subpackages. Constructors of the types
 * and expressions are usually package private. Use the factory classes instead.
 *
 * <p>- {@link hu.bme.mit.theta.core.type.Expr} is the main interface for expressions.
 *
 * <p>- {@link hu.bme.mit.theta.core.type.anytype} and {@link
 * hu.bme.mit.theta.core.type.abstracttype} are expressions for multiple types (e.g., conditional).
 * - {@link hu.bme.mit.theta.core.type.booltype} contains the Boolean type and expressions (e.g.,
 * and, or). - {@link hu.bme.mit.theta.core.type.bvtype} contains the (SMT) bitvector type and
 * expressions (e.g., bitwise and, shifts). - {@link hu.bme.mit.theta.core.type.inttype} contains
 * the mathematical (SMT) integer type and expressions (e.g., add, multiply). - {@link
 * hu.bme.mit.theta.core.type.rattype} contains the rational type and expression (e.g., division). -
 * {@link hu.bme.mit.theta.core.type.arraytype} contains the SMT array type (associative mapping
 * from a key type to a value type) and expressions (e.g., read, write). - {@link
 * hu.bme.mit.theta.core.type.functype} contains the function type and expressions.
