This project provides classes and utilities to build and manipulate first order logic (FOL)
expressions, statements and related concepts, which serve as a basis for the formalisms and
analyses.

Classes include

* types (e.g., Boolean, integer, rational, array, bitvector),
  see the [`package-info.java`](src/main/java/hu/bme/mit/theta/core/type/package-info.java) for more
  details,
* declarations (e.g., constants, variables),
  see the [`package-info.java`](src/main/java/hu/bme/mit/theta/core/decl/package-info.java) for more
  details,
* expressions (e.g., logical connectives, arithmetic operations),
  see the [`package-info.java`](src/main/java/hu/bme/mit/theta/core/type/package-info.java) for more
  details,
* models (e.g., assignments, valuations),
  see the [`package-info.java`](src/main/java/hu/bme/mit/theta/core/model/package-info.java) for
  more details,
* statements (e.g., assign, assume, havoc),
  see the [`package-info.java`](src/main/java/hu/bme/mit/theta/core/stmt/package-info.java) for more
  details.

Utilities include folding, unfolding, collecting atoms, collecting variables, etc.,
see the [`package-info.java`](src/main/java/hu/bme/mit/theta/core/utils/package-info.java) for more
details.
