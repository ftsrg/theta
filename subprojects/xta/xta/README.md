## Overview

This project contains the Uppaal timed automata (XTA) formalism. Its main purpose is to describe
timed systems as graphs with clock variables. A domain specific language (DSL) is available to parse
XTAs from the textual representation of Uppaal. The project contains:

* Classes to represent XTAs.
* A domain specific language (DSL) to parse XTAs from a textual representation.
