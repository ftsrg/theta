 * @param segment A `segment` is a sequence of one or more waypoints. They are used to structure the

 *   it ends with the `target` waypoint and it is called _normal_ otherwise. items: type: object
 *   required: - waypoint properties: waypoint: type: object required: - type - action - location
 *   description: | The `waypoint` elements are the basic building block of violation witnesses.
 *   They have the form of simple restrictions on program executions. Technically, a waypoint is a
 *   mapping with four keys, namely type, location, constraint, and action. The values of the first
 *   three keys specify the requirement on a program execution to pass a waypoint: `type` describes
 *   the type of the requirement, `location` specifies the program location where the requirement is
 *   evaluated, and `constraint` gives the requirement itself and is not allowed for waypoints of
 *   type `function_enter` and `target`. The key `action` then states whether the executions
 *   represented by the witness should pass through the waypoint (value `follow`) or avoid it (value
 *   `avoid`). The format currently supports two possible values of type with the following
 *   meanings: - `assumption`: The location has to point to the beginning of a statement or a
 *   declaration inside a compound statement. A requirement of this type says that a given
 *   constraint is satisfied before the pointed statement or declaration inside a compound
 *   statement. The constraint is a mapping with two keys: `format` specifies the language of the
 *   assumption and `value` contains a side-effect-free assumption over variables in the current
 *   scope. The value of `format` is `c_expression` as C expressions are the only assumptions
 *   currently supported. In future, we plan to support also assumptions in ACSL. - `target`: This
 *   type of requirement can be used only with action `follow` and it marks the program location
 *   where the property is violated. More precisely, the location points at the first character of
 *   the statement or full expression whose evaluation is sequenced directly before the violation
 *   occurs, i.e., there is no other evaluation sequenced before the violation and the sequence
 *   point associated with the location. This also implies that it can only point to a function call
 *   if it calls a function of the C standard library
 * @param invariant The key `invariant` is the basic building block of correctness witnesses. It is
 *   a mapping that describes one invariant.

 *   first character of the statement or full expression whose evaluation is sequenced directly
 *   before the violation occurs, i.e., there is no other evaluation sequenced before the violation
 *   and the sequence point associated with the location. This also implies that it can only point
 *   to a function call if it calls a function of the C standard library that violates the property
 *   or if the function call itself is the property violation. The key constraint has to be omitted
 *   for type `target`.
 * - `function_enter`: The location points to the right parenthesis after the function arguments at
 *   the call site and the requirement says that the called function is entered. The key constraint
 *   has to be omitted in this case.
 * - `function_return`: Such a requirement says that a given function call has been evaluated and
 *   the returned value satisfies a given constraint. The location points to the right parenthesis
 *   after the function arguments at the call site. The constraint is a mapping with keys format and
 *   value. We currently support only ACSL expressions of the form `\result <op>
 *   <const_expression>`, where `<op>` is one of `==`, `!=`, `<=`, `<`, `>`, `>=` and
 *   `<const_expression>` is a constant expression. The value of format has to be `acsl_expression`.
 * - `branching`: A requirement of this type says that a given branching is evaluated in a given
 *   way. The location points to a branching keyword like `if`, `while`, `switch`, or to the
 *   character `?` in the ternary operator (`?:`). The constraint is then a mapping with only one
 *   key value. For binary branchings, value can be either `true` or `false` saying whether the true
 *   branch is used or not. For the keyword switch, value holds an integer constant or default. The
 *   integer constant specifies the value of the controlling expression of the switch statement. The
 *   value default says that the value of this expression does not match any case of the switch with
 *   the potential exception of the default case.
 *
 * An `assumption` waypoint is evaluated at the sequence point immediately before the waypoint
 * location. The waypoint is passed if the given constraint evaluates to true. A `branching`
 * waypoint is evaluated at the sequence point immediately after evaluation of the controlling
 * expression of the corresponding branching statement. The waypoint is passed if the resulting
 * value of the controlling expression corresponds to the given constraint. A `function_enter`
 * waypoint is evaluated at the sequence point immediately after evaluation of all arguments of the
 * function call. The waypoint is passed without any additional constraint. A `function_return`
 * waypoint is evaluated immediately after evaluation of the corresponding function call. The
 * waypoint is passed if the returned value satisfies the given constraint.
 *
 * @param type
 * @param constraint The constraint of the waypoint. A constraint is not allowed for type `target`.
 * @param location The `location` is a mapping with mandatory keys file_name and line. All other
 *   keys are optional. If the location provides an inconsistent information (e.g., identifier
 *   specifies a function that is not called at the given column on the given line ), the witness is
 *   syntactically invalid.
 * @param action Action `follow` means that the waypoint should be passed through. Action `avoid`
 *   means that the waypoint should be avoided.
