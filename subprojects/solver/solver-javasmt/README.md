This project wraps the [JavaSMT solver wrapper](https://github.com/sosy-lab/java-smt) into our common interfaces for solvers (located in the [solver](../solver) project).
Normally, only the factory class should be used from this project to instantiate a new solver and then the common interfaces should be preferred. The [factory](./src/main/java/hu/bme/mit/theta/solver/javasmt/JavaSMTSolverFactory.java) needs a [Solvers](https://github.com/sosy-lab/java-smt/blob/12ceedfa6a8412268f77b8a7af7fb7a1b97bbd29/src/org/sosy_lab/java_smt/SolverContextFactory.java#L51-L61) enum value, or the [manager](./src/main/java/hu/bme/mit/theta/solver/javasmt/JavaSMTSolverManager.java) needs a string with the same values after the `JavaSMT:` prefix.
