## Overview

**This project is in alpha state. Expect breaking changes in the near future!**

This project wraps a generic solver that supports the SMT-LIB2 interface into our common interfaces
for solvers (located in the [solver](..) project).

  compatible solvers.

## SMT-LIB2

The [SMT-LIB2 standard](http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/) is an international initiative, whose goal is
to partly provide a common input and output language for SMT solvers. The standard is adapted by
many SMT solvers, such as Z3, MathSAT, CVC4, etc...

However, there are some limitation to this standard, both in terms of its content and its practical
application by the solvers that support it:

* There are no standard way of denoting an array literal in SMT-LIB. Each solver that support the
  said theory used to come up with a solution of their own in this matter. This lead to the creation
  of the `as-array` (Z3), and the `as const` (CVC4, MathSAT) constructs. Nowadays, solvers tend to
  support the `as const` construct (event the newer versions of Z3).
* There are no standard way of denoting interpolation. Solvers that support interpolation (Z3,
  SMTInterpol, MathSAT) have their own extension added to SMT-LIB to support this feature.
* The support for the standard tends to be loose in some solvers. For example, MathSAT expects a
  numeric argument to `push` and `pop`, does not default to 1, like the standard. Moreover, MathSAT
  uses a custom output language when outputting models, that is not part of the standard.

This list is unfortunately far from being complete, so one has to be careful when integrating a new
solver with SMT-LIB support.

## Architecture

The issues of compatibility described in the earlier section warranted to be considered in the
architecture. The component is designed to be a composite of subcomponents along well-defined
interfaced that make it possible to replace complete subcomponents if for the sake of a solver.

### Generic architecture interface

In general, to have an SMT-LIB supporting solver, components implementing the following interfaces
has to be developed:

* `SmtLibTransformationManager`: Transforms anything in Theta to their SMT-LIB counterpart. It uses
  further components for this feature:
    * `SmtLibTypeTransformer`: Transforms a Theta type to and SMT-LIB type.
    * `SmtLibDeclTransformer`: Transforms a Theta declaration to an SMT-LIB declaration.
    * `SmtLibExprTransformer`: Transforms a Theta expression to an SMT-LIB expression.
    * `SmtLibSymbolTable`: Caches the Theta declarations and their SMT-LIB counterpart.
* `SmtLibTermTransformer`: Transforms an SMT-LIB expression to a Theta expression. It provides
  methods that ensure type-safety.
* `SmtLibSolverBinary`: Provides an interface to communicate with the binary of the solver.
* `SmtLibSolverInstaller`: An interface to support installation scripts and solver management.

The SMT-LIB grammar that the component supports is defined using ANTLR. The ANTLR grammar can be
found in the source folder (`SMTLIBv2.g4`).

The components above are integrated into a working solver implementation with Theta's solver
interface by the following classes:

* `SmtLibSolver`: Provides a solver implementing Theta's `Solver` and `UCSolver` interface
  supporting basic satisfiability checks, model querying and unsat core querying.
* `BaseSmtLibItpSolver`: Provides a solver implementing Theta's `ItpSolver` interface supporting
  interpolating solvers. **Note**: As interpolation is not part of the SMT-LIB standard, this class
  is abstract. Each solver supporting interpolation has to extend this class and configure it
  properly.

### Generic interface implementation

The interfaces above have a default, generic implementation that works with solvers that follow the
SMT-LIB standard fully. These generic classes can be found in
the `hu.bme.mit.theta.solver.smtlib.impl.generic` package.

### Solver specific implementations

Right now, the solver-smtlib subproject supports the following solvers. Each package contains the
specialization of the interfaces above that communicate with the said solver:

* **Boolector** (`hu.bme.mit.theta.solver.smtlib.impl.boolector`): The solver specializes in
  bitvector and array theories, but lacks support for others. It cannot interpolate or produce unsat
  cores, so it can only be used for abstraction.
* **CVC4** (`hu.bme.mit.theta.solver.smtlib.impl.cvc4`): The solver supports basic satisfiability
  problems for numerous theories (integers, rationals, quantifiers, arrays, bitvectors).
* **Mathsat5** (`hu.bme.mit.theta.solver.smtlib.impl.mathsat`): The solver supports basic
  satisfiability problems for numerous theories (integers, rationals, quantifiers, arrays,
  bitvectors, floating points). It also supports interpolation (binary, sequential and tree
  interpolation) with many of them.
* **Princess** (`hu.bme.mit.theta.solver.smtlib.impl.princess`): The solver supports basic
  satisfiability problems for numerous theories (integers, rationals, quantifiers, arrays,
  bitvectors). It also supports interpolation (binary, sequential and tree interpolation) with many
  of them.
* **SMTInterpol** (`hu.bme.mit.theta.solver.smtlib.impl.smtinterpol`): The solver specializes in
  integer and rational theories. It also supports interpolation (binary, sequential and tree
  interpolation) with them.
* **Yices2** (`hu.bme.mit.theta.solver.smtlib.impl.yices2`): The solver supports basic
  satisfiability problems for numerous theories (integers, rationals, quantifiers, arrays,
  bitvectors).
* **Z3** (`hu.bme.mit.theta.solver.smtlib.impl.z3`): The solver supports basic satisfiability
  problems for numerous theories (integers, rationals, quantifiers, arrays, bitvectors, functions),
  and supports interpolation as well (binary, sequential and tree interpolation) up to version 4.7.
